"""Key performance indicators: net present cost and levelised cost of electricity.

Reuses the THESIS net-present-cost accounting (``src/dispatch_assessment/stage2.py``):
capital cost, O&M, fuel, periodic battery replacement and end-of-horizon salvage,
annualised through the capital recovery factor. KPIs are reported per node and as the
probability-weighted expectation over the tree.

Brownfield / replacement accounting: existing capacity (C^g_0) is sunk and carries no
capital charge; only added modules and generator upgrades are costed. Each asset carries
a vintage so that battery replacement, generator resale/transfer (V^ge_s) and
end-of-horizon salvage are timed and depreciated from the installation date, not from
year 0.
