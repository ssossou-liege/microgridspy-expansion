# microgrid-expansion

A multi-stage stochastic capacity-expansion model for sizing off-grid microgrids
(PV array + diesel generator + LiFePO4 battery + hybrid inverter + community load)
under uncertainty.

The model is an adaptive multi-stage stochastic program formulated on a scenario
tree and solved as a single deterministic-equivalent MILP with
[linopy](https://linopy.readthedocs.io/) (HiGHS by default, Gurobi optional). Unlike
a cost-optimal dispatch, the operational layer encodes the **uGrid rule-based
generation-balance control** as binary-light MILP constraints.

## Quick start

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate microgrid-expansion
pip install -e .
python -m microgrid_expansion.run        # build tree -> assemble MILP -> solve -> KPIs
```

## Modelling choices

- **Structure:** adaptive multi-stage stochastic program on a scenario tree
  (two-stage is the special case of a single investment node at year 0).
- **Objective:** risk-neutral — minimise probability-weighted expected discounted
  total cost; report LCOE.
- **Dispatch:** uGrid generation-balance control encoded as MILP constraints, one
  binary per timestep (generator on/off).
- **Design variables:** integer increments of capacity (PV panels, battery modules)
  plus discrete generator/inverter catalogs, decided per tree node with
  structural non-anticipativity.

See [docs/formulation/model.tex](docs/formulation/model.tex) for the full mathematical
formulation.
